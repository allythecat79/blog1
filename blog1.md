## Yarns
  There are *many* fibers that yarn are made from.  Some of the common fibers used are

    * sheep wool
    * alpaca wool
    * cotton
    * man-made fiber

## Stitches
  There are many stitches you can use to make various textures.  Some *basic* stitches are

  * stockinette stitch
  * basket weave
  * garter stitch
  * seed stitch

##  Pattern resources

  There are *lots* of places to find patterns.  If your grandmother knit, you might have some of her old patterns lying around.  She probably wishes she had the world wide web to pull from.  Here are some great websites to use.

Knitting is a great way for me to have a creative outlet and relieve stress.  I hope you can find a passion for it too!
